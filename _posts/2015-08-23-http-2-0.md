Led by: `tollmanz`, `ericlewis`

HTTP/2 requires TLS, which means sites need to be served over HTTPS to reap its benefits.
Zack Tollman and Eric Lewis are going to come up with:

* Ways to educate the community about the process for serving your site over HTTPS
* How to test HTTPS locally
* What changes need to be made in WordPress to allow sites to send the proper headers for HTTP/2
* Mixed content issues still remain for HTTP/HTTPS

[HTTP/2 is a replacement for how HTTP is expressed “on the wire.”](https://http2.github.io/)

"One major goal is to allow the use of a single connection from browsers to a Web site.

The basis of the work was SPDY, but HTTP/2 has evolved to take the community’s input into account, incorporating several improvements in the process."
