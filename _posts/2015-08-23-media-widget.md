This is on Mel Choyce's [wishlist](https://choycedesign.com/2015/01/23/my-top-wordpress-pain-points/).

Instead of just an "Image" widget that uses the Media Library, why not a Media widget? Sheri
got started on this in 4.3, will continue to work on it in 4.4 with advice from Mel and
code review from me.
