Weston and Nick have been iterating on the Customizer pretty heavily for the past
several releases. Nav Menus are using a new technique that does partial refreshes to the
Customizer iframe, instead of full reloads. The benefits are already being seen
performance-wise.

On the burner for this release:

* [Partial Refresh](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/27355)
* potentially, [Transactions](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30937)
